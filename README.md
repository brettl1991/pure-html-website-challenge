Feel free to add other pages, if you think they are an important aspect of your project.

## Goal

The goal of this challenge is to build a website using only HTML, without using any CSS or JavaScript. But that doesn't mean your website has to be boring or lackluster! On the contrary, you will need to think creatively to ensure that your website is engaging, easy to use, and visually stunning.

Your website must be able to navigate around, so that users can easily consume the data you provide. It's also important to have a consistent layout throughout the website, with clear headings, subheadings, and sections. You'll need to think carefully about how you organize your content to ensure that it's easy to understand and follow.

But don't let the limitations of using only HTML hold you back! With the right approach and mindset, you can create a website that is a true work of art. Think about the story you want to tell, the message you want to convey, and the user experience you want to provide. Then, use your HTML skills to bring that story to life in a way that is both beautiful and functional.
